//! Client-side pieces of the local-to-cloud Oz conversation handoff:
//!
//! - Payload types (`HandoffLaunchAttachments`, `PendingCloudLaunch`) carry the
//!   compose/auto-submit request from the input into the handoff pipeline.
//! - `pipeline`: prepares a handoff from shared conversation state, preserves
//!   the prompt and attachments needed for failure restoration, and executes
//!   the server fork, frontend materialization, snapshot upload, and cloud run
//!   spawn in a fixed order.
//! - `snapshot`: gives the pipeline one local/remote snapshot-upload interface.
//! - `touched_repos`: walks the conversation's action history to collect every
//!   filesystem path the local agent has touched, groups those paths into git
//!   roots and orphan files, and exposes the env-overlap pick used by the
//!   handoff pane bootstrap.
//!
//! A frontend first calls `prepare_handoff` to enforce source guardrails and
//! obtain a `PendingHandoff`. It may update the pending environment or model
//! selection before passing ownership to `execute_handoff`. The execution
//! pipeline invokes the frontend's materialization callback after selecting or
//! creating the server conversation fork, then prepares the workspace snapshot
//! and spawns the cloud run. The resulting outcome contains the state each
//! frontend needs to monitor the created run or restore failed input.
